# Haskell Fall 2023

### Homework 1

1. Create the environment using [the guide](https://www.haskell.org/get-started/)
    - make sure you answer yes to installing HLS using GHCup
    - VSCode may ask you which HLS to use in a pop-up window -- select the one from GHCup
2. Do your homework in the `hw1.hs` file from this branch
3. Tests in this hw do not require any additional frameworks: use comparison

### Selected commands

* `ghci` to call REPL
    - you should see `ghci>`
* for `ghci>`:
    - `:l hw1.hs` to load your file `hw1.hs`
    - `:r` to reload already loaded files
    - `:t [1, 2]` to see the type of your expression `[1, 2]`
